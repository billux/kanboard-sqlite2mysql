# Kanboard - SQLite2PostgreSQL

This is a fork of [oliviermaridat/kanboard-sqlite2mysql](https://github.com/oliviermaridat/kanboard-sqlite2mysql) with additional changes to make the resulting dump compatible with PostgreSQL.

For usage, please refer to the [initial README](https://github.com/oliviermaridat/kanboard-sqlite2mysql/blob/master/README.md).

The script was used to migrate SQLite schema version 125 to PostgreSQL 13 schema version 115.
